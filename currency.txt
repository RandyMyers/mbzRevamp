Our currency conversion API supports two different authentication methods. This page explains the details of both and gives some brief info on the security trade offs between each approach.


‚ö° Default In-URL Authentication
Our default authentication scheme is to simply include your API key in the URL that you send a GET request to. Here's an example:

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR-API-KEY/latest/USD
This is the fastest way to get started. You can actually just paste this GET request in your browser and immediately see your JSON response, no need to even fire up curl.

The disadvantage is that your API key can get included in logging as a result of being contained in the URL. Considering that our service doesn't store any user data and the keys' purpose is just access control & rate limiting most users are OK with this security tradeoff.


üîê Token Bearer Authentication
For customers that are more concerned about this logging risk or have to meet audit requirements for all their integrated services we offer another common authentication approach called Token Bearer.

Some implementations of this method have a more complex process (e.g. JWT) but ours is very simple - your API key is simply the token and there is no need to follow any signing process or fetch a short lived Access Token.

Authentication with this method is handled by the passing of an HTTP header with the following format:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR-API-KEY
You must omit the `YOUR-API-KEY` section from your request URLs in order to use this authentication method. Here's an example URL:

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/latest/USD

üñ•Ô∏è What About Client Side Auth?
If you want to generate API requests from client side code our usual suggestion is to make regular requests on a schedule from your infrastructure and then save the responses in your datastore. You can then handle requests from your users within your existing infrastructure and auth approach (if any). Our terms do permit caching of our data and with this approach you can avoid the need to manage authentication in public code.

Overview
Our Standard API endpoint is the easiest and fastest way to access our exchange rate data. It's available on all plans including Free.

Choose your base currency and the Standard endpoint will simply return the conversion rates from your base currency code to all the others we support in an easy to parse JSON format.


Usage Guide
To use our Standard endpoint simply make the two substitutions explained below and then send a GET request.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `YOUR-API-KEY` with the API key displayed in your dashboard.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `USD` with the code you want to use as a base currency.

We use ISO 4217 Three Letter Currency Codes - e.g. USD for US Dollars, EUR for Euro etc. Here are the codes we support.

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR-API-KEY/latest/USD
This will return the exchange rates from your base code to all the other currencies we support:

Pair Conversion Requests
Documentation for the Pair ExchangeRate-API endpoint.

Overview
Our Pair Conversion API endpoint is useful for applications where you just want to convert between two specific currencies and aren't interested in any others.

You'll need to choose your base currency code and the target currency you'd like to get the exchange rate for. You'll then get a minimal JSON response back from our API with exactly the data you need. It's a much smaller response than the one you'd get from our Standard endpoint - quick & easy to develop with.


Usage Guide
To use our Pair endpoint simply make the substitutions explained below and then send a GET request.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `YOUR-API-KEY` with the API key displayed in your dashboard.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `EUR` with the code you want to use as a base currency.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `GBP` with the code you want to use as a target currency.

We use ISO 4217 Three Letter Currency Codes - e.g. USD for US Dollars, EUR for Euro etc. Here are the codes we support.

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR-API-KEY/pair/EUR/GBP
This will return the exchange rate from your base code to the other currency you supplied:

{
	"result": "success",

Enriched Data Requests
Documentation for the Enriched ExchangeRate-API endpoint.

Overview
Our Enriched API endpoint offers the most comprehensive data on each currency you're interested in converting to. It's only available to users on our Business or Volume plans.

You'll need to choose your base currency code and the target currency you'd like to get enriched data for. The API's JSON response will include the country name, country code & flag image URL for the target currency, as well as the currency name and its display symbol.


Usage Guide
To use our Enriched endpoint make the three substitutions explained below and then send a GET request.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `YOUR-API-KEY` with the API key displayed in your dashboard.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `GBP` with the code you want to use as a base currency.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `JPY` with the code you want to use as a target currency.

We use ISO 4217 Three Letter Currency Codes - e.g. USD for US Dollars, EUR for Euro etc. Here are the codes we support.

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR-API-KEY/enriched/GBP/JPY
This will return the exchange rate from your base code to the target code, as well as extra data for the target currency:

{
	"result": "success",
	"documentation": "https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs",
	"terms_of_use": "https://www.exchangerate-api.com/terms",

		"currency_name_short": "Yen",
		"display_symbol": "00A5",
		"flag_url": "https://www.exchangerate-api.com/img/docs/JP.gif"
	}
}

NOTE: How to Use Currency Display Symbols

We supply a comma delimited list of unicode hex references for use in your HTML. You will need to separate and then wrap these hex codes with &#x and ; as follows:

"043B,0432"
would become

&#x043B;&#x0432;
yielding –ª–≤.

Note that sometimes just a single hex reference will be returned, i.e. without any commas. For instance just "0024", which when wrapped as

&#x0024;
will display the $ symbol.


Error Responses
{
	"result": "error",
	"error-type": "unknown-code"
}
Where "error-type" can be any of the following:

"unsupported-code" if we don't support the supplied currency code (see supported currencies...).
"malformed-request" when some part of your request doesn't follow the structure shown above.

"inactive-account" if your email address wasn't confirmed.
"quota-reached" when your account has reached the the number of requests allowed by your plan.
"plan-upgrade-required" if your plan level doesn't support this type of request.

Historical Data Requests
Documentation for the Historical Data ExchangeRate-API endpoint.

Overview
Our Historical Exchange Rates API endpoint lets you fetch all the exchange rate data we have available for a specific day in the past. It's only available to users on our Pro, Business or Volume plans.

There are two distinct data sets used by the endpoint.

From 1 January 2021 onwards we have data for our entire list of supported currencies available.

From 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2020 we offer data for the following smaller list of currency codes:

AUD	ATS	BEF	BRL	CAD	CHF	CNY	DEM
DKK	ESP	EUR	FIM	FRF	GBP	GRD	HKD
IEP	INR	IRR	ITL	JPY	KRW	LKR	MXN
MYR	NOK	NLG	NZD	PTE	SEK	SGD	THB
TWD	USD	ZAR

Important Notes
We blend data from different sources to reduce inaccuracies & provide one indicative mid-rate for each calendar day. This data is suitable for reporting, dashboards, academic studies, spreadsheets, market insights etc. but shouldn't be used for processing cross-currency settlements or backtesting day trading models. For these you should use the rates supplied by the banks involved in your planned transactions or the historical spread & price data from the markets you plan to trade in.
Historical exchange rates are only accessible by paid accounts.
Data for some currencies is only available for certain time periods - for instance a number of currencies were replaced with the Euro from 1999 onwards.

Usage Guide - Basic Format
To use our Historical Exchange Rates endpoint you'll need to make the substitutions explained below and then send a GET request.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `YOUR-API-KEY` with the API key displayed in your dashboard.

Supported Codes JSON
Documentation for the Supported Codes ExchangeRate-API endpoint.

Overview
This endpoint lists the currencies that we support. It's essentially a programmatic JSON version of the human readable page listing our supported currencies.

This endpoint is useful for making your application dynamically support the same currencies we offer data for. In the event that a new currency is added or one removed then this endpoint can be relied on to make sure your application stays up to date. This only happens very rarely so not all users will need to worry about this - but it's useful for those who want the extra assurance.

The JSON response also includes the name of the currency if you're looking to display these somewhere on your website or app. Please note that some include unicode characters, for instance the Mongolian T√∂gr√∂g.


Usage Guide
To use our Supported Codes endpoint simply include your API key and send a GET request to the URL below, nothing else required.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `YOUR-API-KEY` with the API key displayed in your dashboard.

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR-API-KEY/codes
This will return a JSON array of all currently supported currencies:

{
	"result":"success",
	"documentation":"https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs",
	"terms_of_use":"https://www.exchangerate-api.com/terms"
	"supported_codes":[
		["AED","UAE Dirham"],
		["AFN","Afghan Afghani"],
		["ALL","Albanian Lek"],

		["ARS","Argentine Peso"],
		["AUD","Australian Dollar"],
		["AWG","Aruban Florin"],
		["AZN","Azerbaijani Manat"],
		["BAM","Bosnia and Herzegovina Convertible Mark"],
		["BBD","Barbados Dollar"] etc. etc.
	]
}

Error Responses
{
	"result": "error",
	"error-type": "invalid-key"
}
Where "error-type" can be any of the following:

"invalid-key" when your API key is not valid.
"inactive-account" if your email address wasn't confirmed.
"quota-reached" when your account has reached the the number of requests allowed by your plan.

API Request Quota
Documentation for the API Request Quota ExchangeRate-API endpoint.

Overview
Some users like to track the amount of available API request quota they have left from within the same script or service that is consuming our exchange rate data. This endpoint makes this possible by returning a JSON formatted response that shows what your plan's quota level is and how many requests you have remaining in the current period.

Please note two important points about this endpoint:

1. There is a delay between your system sending requests and these reflecting in your official request usage count and available quota indication. This is due to various scheduled scripts having to collect your usage counts from the different parts & caching layers of our infrastructure. The delay can range from 5 minutes to 60 minutes depending on circumstances.

2. Unfortunately we have to make requests to this API endpoint count against your request usage quota. We'd prefer not to and originally this wasn't the case but users kept putting requests to this endpoint in while(1){} loops and generating tens of millions of unnecessary requests. Our Pro plan does include 30k API requests per month so you'll still be able to monitor this at a reasonable frequency.

Finally, a note on the `refresh_day_of_month` field. Our API request quotas get renewed on the day of the month that you started your current plan and not simply on the 1st. Accordingly, the JSON response also includes the date of each month that your account gets new request quota allocated.


Usage Guide
To use our API Request Quota endpoint simply swap in your API key and then send a GET request to the URL below.

‚Ä¢ Substitute `YOUR-API-KEY` with the API key displayed in your dashboard.

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR-API-KEY/quota
This will return a JSON array of your current API request quota status:

{
	"result": "success",
	"documentation": "https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs",
	"terms_of_use": "https://www.exchangerate-api.com/terms",
	"plan_quota": 30000,
	"requests_remaining": 25623,
	"refresh_day_of_month": 17
}

Error Responses
{
	"result": "error",
	"error-type": "invalid-key"
}
Where "error-type" can be any of the following:

"invalid-key" when your API key is not valid.
"inactive-account" if your email address wasn't confirmed.
"quota-reached" when your account has reached the the number of requests allowed by your plan.

Open Access Endpoint
Documentation for the Free & Open Access ExchangeRate-API endpoint

Intro
If you want a free exchange rates API with no API key requirement for a small project then this is what you're looking for!

This open access API is subject to our Terms and requires attribution. You're welcome to cache the data we respond with and to use it for either personal or commercial currency conversion purposes. You are, however, not allowed to re-distribute it.

Rate Limiting
We've been providing free versions of our currency conversion API for over 10 years now and have experienced the inevitable DDoS attacks & broken while(1){} loops during this time. As such our open access free exchange rate API has to be rate limited.

‚Ä¢ If you only request once every 24 hours you won't need to read any more of this section. Easy!
‚Ä¢ If you can't keep a cached response for that long, you could still request once every hour and never get rate limited.

These suggestions are quite reasonable because:

‚Ä¢ The data only refreshes once every 24 hours anyway.
‚Ä¢ Included in the response is the specific time of the next data update.
‚Ä¢ Our Terms permit caching of the data.

Don't panic if you send too many requests due to a bug and get rate limited. Rate limited IP's will receive HTTP code 429 responses. After 20 minutes the rate limit will finish and new requests will be allowed through.


Attribution
We require attribution on the pages you're using these rates with the link below:

<a href="https://www.exchangerate-api.com">Rates By Exchange Rate API</a>
Why bother? Well, the more popular our service gets the better we can make this free & open access version and the longer we'll maintain it! We've been empowering developers with free data since 2010 and each year the positive feedback and developers doing fair attribution outweigh the people trying to abuse & DDoS the endpoint. Let's keep this convenient service going for another 10 years!

You're also welcome to make the attribution link discreet and in keeping with how the rest of your application looks - we leave this up to you.


Request Format Documentation
We use ISO 4217 Three Letter Currency Codes - e.g. USD for US Dollars, EUR for Euro etc. Here's the list of currency codes we support.

Just switch the USD currency code in the below request with the code for the currency you'd like to get data for.

GET https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD

Uptime
You can view the uptime record for this endpoint, as monitored by Pingdom, here: Open Access Endpoint Uptime.


Note on EOL field
Over time we inevitably have to stop supporting certain endpoints or infrastructure and we can't predict when this will be. A lot of free services don't worry about this and just come and go - leaving users in trouble when they suddenly close down.

So whenever the time comes that we need to stop supporting this endpoint the `time_eol` field will start showing the unix time of expected deprecation. This way you can set appropriate alerting in your code and have some time to make a new plan.


Error Responses
Successful responses will show success for the result field. In the event that there is an error in serving the response this field will state error and another field called error-type with further information will be returned.

Supported Currencies
List of currency codes and countries supported by our API endpoints

This page describes all the world currencies supported by our exchange rate API and the codes used to describe them in our responses. The "Currency Code" field you see at the start of each line below is the ISO 4217 Three Letter Currency Code for that currency. Wherever you see a currency code field in our API documentation you must supply one of the codes from this list.

Please note that ISO 4217 codes can be deprecated and replaced over time. An example would be Mexico using MXP prior to the 1993 currency revalution but now using MXN to indicate the subsequent version of the Mexican Peso. Some online lists of currency codes still use old codes - so check here if you're uncertain about which codes to include in your currency conversion project.

You can read more about ISO 4217 codes on Wikipedia.


Unsupported Currencies

There is only 1 widely known currency we don't offer exchange rate data for due to sanctions & lack of any international trade.

Currency Code
Currency Name
Country
KPW	North Korean Won	North Korea

If you need KPW data the only reliable source of the actual rates available at jangmadang markets in DPRK is Daily NK, which reports on news from inside North Korea via human sources. There is technically an official rate set by the DPRK's Central Bank but this hasn't been updated for years and essentially never reflected actual rates of exchange.


Notes For Some Supported Currencies

The following currencies experience heightened volatility & substantial differences between actual rates of exchange available in different markets and those published officially. In these instances we default to the rates published by the appropriate central banks. Please take extra caution when using our data for these currencies as there is a chance it might disagree with other sources.

API Authentication Notes
Details on the two available authentication methods.

Our currency conversion API supports two different authentication methods. This page explains the details of both and gives some brief info on the security trade offs between each approach.


‚ö° Default In-URL Authentication
Our default authentication scheme is to simply include your API key in the URL that you send a GET request to. Here's an example:

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR-API-KEY/latest/USD
This is the fastest way to get started. You can actually just paste this GET request in your browser and immediately see your JSON response, no need to even fire up curl.

The disadvantage is that your API key can get included in logging as a result of being contained in the URL. Considering that our service doesn't store any user data and the keys' purpose is just access control & rate limiting most users are OK with this security tradeoff.


üîê Token Bearer Authentication
For customers that are more concerned about this logging risk or have to meet audit requirements for all their integrated services we offer another common authentication approach called Token Bearer.

Some implementations of this method have a more complex process (e.g. JWT) but ours is very simple - your API key is simply the token and there is no need to follow any signing process or fetch a short lived Access Token.

Authentication with this method is handled by the passing of an HTTP header with the following format:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR-API-KEY
You must omit the `YOUR-API-KEY` section from your request URLs in order to use this authentication method. Here's an example URL:

GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/latest/USD

üñ•Ô∏è What About Client Side Auth?
If you want to generate API requests from client side code our usual suggestion is to make regular requests on a schedule from your infrastructure and then save the responses
 in your datastore. You can then handle requests from your users within your existing infrastructure and auth approach (if any). Our terms do permit caching of our data and with this approach you can avoid the need to manage authentication in public code.
