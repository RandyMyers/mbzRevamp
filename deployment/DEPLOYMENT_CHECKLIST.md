## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| 502 Bad Gateway | Check if PM2 app is running: `pm2 status` |
| MongoDB connection failed | Verify credentials in `.env`, check MongoDB is running |
| SSL certificate error | Check DNS propagation, re-run certbot |
| High memory usage | Restart PM2: `pm2 restart all` |
| Can't SSH | Check firewall rules: `ufw status` |
| Application won't start | Check logs: `pm2 logs --lines 100` |
